# MyStuff  
This project spawned from my desire to know what I own. I was moving towards the beginning of 2022 and when I was packing, it seemed like I had more and more stuff. It was a stressful experience to the point where I got the idea for this app. If I could itemize, organize, and visualize the permanent items that I own (excluding ever changing items like food or cleaning supplies) then I could make moving less stressful by being able to plan ahead how many boxes I need, how long it will take, etc. 

How it works:
- Your space is broken down into **locations**: These locations can be specific rooms or any area that might have some ability to store items in.
- Within these locations, you will have access to **storage** containers, also known as **storages**: These can be dressers, cabinets, shelves, etc. Have something that you keep under your bed? Make a storage called "Bed". We include a couple of examples. This is required to have within each location. The goal is to have some detail as to where an item is in each location. If the only place to put stuff in a location is the floor, then you would create a storage call "Floor".
- Lastly there are the **items** themselves. These can have placement notes, images, whatever you need to identify the item even if you are away from your space.
