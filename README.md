# MyStuff  
This project spawned from my desire to know what I own. I was moving towards the beginning of 2022 and when I was packing, it seemed like I had more and more stuff. It was a stressful experience to the point where I got the idea for this app. If I could itemize, organize, and visualize the permanent items that I own (excluding ever changing items like food or cleaning supplies) then I could make moving less stressful by being able to plan ahead how many boxes I need, how long it will take, etc.
